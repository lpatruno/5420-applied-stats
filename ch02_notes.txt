Chapter 2 - Distributions

- One of best ways to describe a variable is to report the values that appear and how many times each value appears
     - most common representation of a distribution is a histogram, graph that shows frequency of each value

- When looking at a new dataset, itâ€™s good to explore variables one at a time with histograms and look at the 
shape of the data. Is the data distributed according to a normal distribution? Uniform?


Outliers

    - Easy to identify most common values and the shape with histograms, outliers are harder to see
     - outliers are extreme values that might be errors in measurement and recording, or might be accurate reports of rare events
     - best way to handle outliers is with domain knowledge, info about where the data come from and what they mean

- histograms are not the best choice for comparing two distributions
     - visible differences can be due to sample sizes, instead use probability mass functions (next chapter)

- Histogram is a complete description of the distribution of a sample
     - often we want to summarize the distribution with summary statistics
          - central tendency- do values tend to cluster around a particular point
          - modes- is there more than one cluster
          - spread- how much variability is there in the values
          - tails- how quickly do the probabilities drop off as we move away from the modes
          - outliers- are there extreme values from from the modes

- most common summary statistic is the mean
     - sometimes the mean is not a good description of a set of values (when variance is high)

- Sometimes it is better to use mean and variance
     - variance is a summary statistic intended to describe the variability or spread of a distribution about its mean
     - variance is the mean squared deviation
     - the square root of variance is called the standard deviation
     - variance is hard to interpret, especially since the units are weeks^2. useful in some situations, but not a good summary statistic

- An effect size is a summary statistic intended to describe the size of an effect. 
    - For example, to describe the difference between two groups, one obvious choice is the difference in the means
    - Another way of quantifying effect size is Cohen's d.

- When reporting results, it is important to consider
     - the intended audience (scientists vs mothers vs doctors)
     - goals of the study (what story are you trying to tell)
     - ensure that your results and honest and to acknowledge uncertainty and limitations
